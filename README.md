# Worth a Shot

*With this website, users should be able to look up different alcoholic beverages and nearby bars in our search engines as well as saving their favorites to a new page.*

Deployed version can be found [Here](https://michaelmletanosky.github.io/worth-a-shot/)

 ## How to use this site:
1. A modal should pop up to verify the user is above 21; if they click yes, the modal should disappear and the site should be deployed normally. If they select no, they are taken to a new, age appropriate site.
2. Once out of the modal, users should be able to see the header along with a 'Favorites' option on the top right which can take them to another site with any saved items they may want to refer back to.
3. Users can then use the left search engine to find a drink by ingredient. After clicking "Search for my drink," a few drinks (up to 6) should generate from our API, which is pulled from The Cocktail DB. 
4. Then, users should also be able to search nearby bars on the right search engine. This button will generate a few bars on the page (simultaneously while drinks are still showing) and allows users to see bars around them they may have never known about. This information is pulled from Google Places API.
5. When either search engine has found the desired item, there are buttons on the bottom of each card that users can save to their favorites.
6. Users can then click the 'Favorites' button on the top of the page. This website will show them any of their favorites they have added! They can also click 'Take me back home' on this screen which will return them back to the main page.
